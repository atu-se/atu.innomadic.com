<h2>Previous Models</h2>
<ul>
<li>So far in our development of the theory of computation, we have presented several models of computing devices.</li>
<li>Finite automata are good models for devices that have a small amount of memory.</li>
<li>Pushdown automata are good models for devices that have an unlimited memory that is usable only in the last in, first out manner of a stack.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="general-purpose-computers" class="slide level2">
<h2>General Purpose Computers?</h2>
<ul>
<li>We have shown that some very simple tasks are beyond the capabilities of these models.</li>
<li>Hence they are too restricted to serve as models of general purpose computers.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="turing-machine" class="slide level2">
<h2>Turing Machine</h2>
<ul>
<li>We turn now to a much more powerful model, first proposed by Alan Turing in 1936, called the Turing machine.</li>
<li>Similar to a finite automaton but with an unlimited and unrestricted memory, a Turing machine is a much more accurate model of a general purpose computer.</li>
<li>A Turing machine can do everything that a real computer can do.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="turing-machine-limitations" class="slide level2">
<h2>Turing Machine Limitations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Nonetheless, even a Turing machine cannot solve certain problems.</li>
<li>In a very real sense, these problems are beyond the theoretical limits of computation.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="turing-machine-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Turing Machine</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Turing machine model uses an infinite tape as its unlimited memory.</li>
<li>It has a tape head that can read and write symbols and move around on the tape.</li>
<li>Initially the tape contains only the input string and is blank everywhere else.</li>
<li>If the machine needs to store information, it may write this information on the tape.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="turing-machine-2" class="slide level2">
<h2>Turing Machine</h2>
<ul>
<li>To read the information that it has written, the machine can move its head back over it. The machine continues computing until it decides to produce an output.</li>
<li>The outputs accept and reject are obtained by entering designated accepting and rejecting states.</li>
<li>If it doesn’t enter an accepting or a rejecting state, it will go on forever, never halting.</li>
</ul>

<li>Let’s introduce a Turing machine M<sub>1</sub> for testing membership in the language:</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">B = \{ w\#w | w \in \{0,1\}^*\} </span></p>

<li>We want M<sub>1</sub> to accept if its input is a member of B and to reject otherwise.</li>

<h2>Imagine you are the TM</h2>
<ul>
<li>We want M<sub>1</sub> to accept if its input is a member of B and to reject otherwise.</li>
<li>To understand M<sub>1</sub> better, put yourself in its place by imagining that you are standing on a mile-long input consisting of millions of characters.</li>
<li>Your goal is to determine whether the input is a member of B—that is, whether the input comprises two identical strings separated by a # symbol.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="imagine-you-are-the-tm-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Imagine You are the TM</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">The input is too long for you to remember it all, but you are allowed to move back and forth over the input and make marks on it.</li>
<li class="fragment">The obvious strategy is to zig-zag to the corresponding places on the two sides of the # and determine whether they match.</li>
<li class="fragment">Place marks on the tape to keep track of which places correspond.</li>

</section><section id="operation-of-our-tm" class="slide level2">
<h2>Operation of our TM</h2>
<ul>
<li>We design M<sub>1</sub> to work in that way.</li>
<li>It makes multiple passes over the input string with the read–write head.</li>
<li>On each pass it matches one of the characters on each side of the # symbol.</li>
<li>To keep track of which symbols have been checked already, M<sub>1</sub> crosses off each symbol as it is examined.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="operation-of-our-tm-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Operation of our TM</h2>
<ul>
<li>If it crosses off all the symbols, that means that everything matched successfully, and M<sub>1</sub> goes into an accept state.</li>

<h2>Defining a TM</h2>
<ul>
<li>The heart of the definition of a Turing machine is the transition function δ because it tells us how the machine gets from one step to the next.</li>
<li>For a Turing machine, δ takes the form: Q × Γ −→ Q × Γ × {L, R}. That is, when the machine is in a certain state q and the head is over a tape square containing a symbol a, and if δ(q, a) = (r, b, L), the machine writes the symbol b replacing the a, and goes to state r.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="defining-a-tm-2" class="slide level2">
<h2>Defining a TM</h2>
<ul>
<li>The third component is either L or R and indicates whether the head moves to the left or right after writing.</li>
<li>In this case, the L indicates a move to the left.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="formal-definition" class="slide level2">
<h2>Formal Definition</h2>
<p>A Turing machine is a 7-tuple, (Q, Σ, Γ, δ, q0, q<sub>accept</sub>, q<sub>reject</sub>), where Q, Σ, Γ are all finite sets and</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Q is the set of states,</li>
<li>Σ is the input alphabet not containing the blank symbol ␣ ,</li>
<li>Γ is the tape alphabet, where␣ ∈ Γ and Σ ⊆ Γ,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">δ: Q×Γ\longrightarrow Q×Γ×{L,R}</span> is the transition function,</li>
<li>q<sub>0</sub> ∈ Q is the start state,</li>
<li>q<sub>accept</sub> ∈ Q is the accept state, and</li>
<li>q<sub>reject</sub> ∈ Q is the reject state, where q<sub>reject</sub> != q<sub>accept</sub>.</li>
</ol>
</section><section id="computation" class="slide level2">
<h2>Computation</h2>
<ul>
<li>A Turing machine M = (Q, Σ, Γ, δ, q<sub>0</sub>, q<sub>accept</sub>, q<sub>reject</sub>) computes as follows.</li>
<li>Initially, M receives its input <span class="math inline">w = w_{1}w_{2} . . . w_{n} \in \Sigma ^*</span> on the leftmost n squares of the tape, and the rest of the tape is blank (i.e., filled with blank symbols).</li>
<li>The head starts on the leftmost square of the tape.</li>
<li>Note that Σ does not contain the blank symbol, so the first blank appearing on the tape marks the end of the input.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="computation-2" class="slide level2">
<h2>Computation (2)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Once M has started, the computation proceeds according to the rules described by the transition function.</li>
<li>If M ever tries to move its head to the left off the left-hand end of the tape, the head stays in the same place for that move, even though the transition function indicates L.</li>
<li>The computation continues until it enters either the accept or reject states, at which point it halts.</li>
<li>If neither occurs, M goes on forever.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Computation Example (again)</h2>
<img data-src="lecture8-diagram2-m1example.png" title="fig:" alt="M1 Computation" class="stretch" />
</section><section id="tm-configuration" class="slide level2">
<h2>TM Configuration</h2>
<ul>
<li>As a Turing machine computes, changes occur in the current state, the current tape contents, and the current head location.</li>
<li>A setting of these three items is called a configuration of the Turing machine.</li>
<li>Configurations often are represented in a special way.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="tm-configuration-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>TM Configuration</h2>
<ul>
<li>For a state q and two strings u and v over the tape alphabet Γ, we write u q v for the configuration where the current state is q, the current tape contents is uv, and the current head location is the first symbol of v.</li>
<li>The tape contains only blanks following the last symbol of v.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="tm-configuration-2" class="slide level2">
<h2>TM Configuration</h2>
<ul>
<li>For example, 1011q<sub>7</sub>01111 represents the configuration when the tape is 101101111, the current state is q<sub>7</sub>, and the head is currently on the second 0:</li>
</ul>
<img data-src="lecture8-diagram3-configuration.png" title="fig:" alt="A TM with configuration 1011q701111" class="stretch" />
</section><section id="yields" class="slide level2">
<h2>Yields</h2>
<ul>
<li>Say that configuration C1 <em><strong>yields</strong></em> configuration C2 if the Turing machine can legally go from C1 to C2 in a single step.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="yields-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Yields</h2>
<ul>
<li>We define this notion formally as follows.</li>
<li>Suppose that we have a,b, and c in Γ, as well as u and v in Γ* and states q<sub>i</sub> and q<sub>j</sub>. In that case, <span class="math inline">ua\ q_{i}\ bv</span> and <span class="math inline">u\ q_{j}\ acv</span> are two configurations.</li>
<li>Say that: <span class="math inline">ua\ q_{i}\ bv\ \textrm{yields}\ u\ q_{j}\ acv</span> if in the transition function <span class="math inline">δ(q_{i},b) = (q_{j},c,L)</span>.</li>
<li>That handles the case where the Turing machine moves leftward.</li>
<li>For a rightward move, say that <span class="math inline">ua\ q_{i}\ bv\ \textrm{yields}\ uac\ q_{j}\ v</span> if <span class="math inline">δ(q_{i},b) = (q_{j},c,R)</span>.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="special-cases" class="slide level2">
<h2>Special Cases</h2>
<ul>
<li>Special cases occur when the head is at one of the ends of the configuration.</li>
<li>For the left-hand end, the configuration <span class="math inline">q_{i}\ bv \textrm{yields} q_{j}\ cv</span> if the transition is left-moving (because we prevent the machine from going off the left-hand end of the tape), and it yields <span class="math inline">c\ q_{j}\ v</span> for the right-moving transition.</li>
<li>For the right-hand end, the configuration <span class="math inline">ua\ q_{i}</span> is equivalent to <span class="math inline">ua\ q_{i}\ ␣</span> because we assume that blanks follow the part of the tape represented in the configuration.</li>
<li>Thus we can handle this case as before, with the head no longer at the right-hand end.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="special-configurations" class="slide level2">
<h2>Special Configurations</h2>
<ul>
<li>The <em><strong>start configuration</strong></em> of M on input w is the configuration q0 w, which indicates that the machine is in the start state q0 with its head at the leftmost position on the tape.</li>
<li>In an <em><strong>accepting configuration</strong></em>, the state of the configuration is q<sub>accept</sub>.</li>
<li>In a <em><strong>rejecting configuration</strong></em>, the state of the configuration is q<sub>reject</sub>.</li>
<li>Accepting and rejecting configurations are <em><strong>halting configurations</strong></em> and do not yield further configurations.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="alternative-transition-function" class="slide level2">
<h2>Alternative Transition Function</h2>
<ul>
<li>Because the machine is defined to halt when in the states q<sub>accept</sub> and q<sub>reject</sub>, we equivalently could have defined the transition function to have the more complicated form δ:Q′×Γ−→Q×Γ×{L,R}, where Q′ is Q without q<sub>accept</sub> and q<sub>reject</sub>.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="alternative-transition-function-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Alternative Transition Function</h2>
<ul>
<li>A Turing machine M accepts input w if a sequence of configurations C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>, . . . , C<sub>k</sub> exists, where</li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>C<sub>1</sub> is the start configuration of M on input w,</li>
<li>each C<sub>i</sub> yields C<sub>i</sub>+1, and</li>
<li>C<sub>k</sub> is an accepting configuration.</li>
</ol>
</section><section id="language-of-a-tm" class="slide level2">
<h2>Language of a TM</h2>
<ul>
<li>The collection of strings that M accepts is the language of M, or the language recognized by M, denoted L(M).</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="definition-turing-recognizable" class="slide level2">
<h2>Definition: Turing-Recognizable</h2>
<ul>

</ul>
</section><section id="outcomes-of-a-tm" class="slide level2">
<h2>Outcomes of a TM</h2>
<ul>
<li>When we start a Turing machine on an input, three outcomes are possible.</li>
<li>The machine may
<ul>
<li>accept,</li>
<li>reject, or</li>
<li>loop.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>By loop we mean that the machine simply does not halt.</li>
<li>Looping may entail any simple or complex behavior that never leads to a halting state.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="outcomes-of-a-tm-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Outcomes of a TM</h2>
<ul>
<li>A Turing machine M can fail to accept an input by entering the q<sub>reject</sub> state and rejecting, or by looping.</li>
<li>Sometimes distinguishing a machine that is looping from one that is merely taking a long time is difficult.</li>
<li>For this reason, we prefer Turing machines that halt on all inputs; such machines never loop.</li>
<li>These machines are called <em><strong>deciders</strong></em> because they always make a decision to accept or reject.</li>
<li>A decider that recognizes some language also is said to decide that language.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="deciders" class="slide level2">
<h2>Deciders</h2>
<ul>
<li>Call a language <em><strong>Turing-decidable</strong></em> or simply <em><strong>decidable</strong></em> if some Turing machine decides it.</li>

<h2>M2 Analysis</h2>
<ul>
<li>Each iteration of stage 1 cuts the number of 0s in half. As the machine sweeps across the tape in stage 1, it keeps track of whether the number of 0s seen is even or odd.</li>
<li>If that number is odd and greater than 1, the original number of 0s in the input could not have been a power of 2.</li>
<li>Therefore, the machine rejects in this instance.</li>
